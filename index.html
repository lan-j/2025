          <h2>Workshop Aims and Scope</h2>

		<p>This workshop will take the first steps towards developing a <b>blueprint</b> to integrate <b>fairness</b> into AIED research,  
		practice, and adoption. Starting from existing frameworks, including <b>procedural fairness</b> and <b>algorithmic audits</b>, participants will expand 
		upon previous research and work to bring the AIED community into alignment around fairness principles, resulting in 
		the co-creation of a document for embedding fairness into AIED research, practice, and adoption.</p>
			
		<p>Designed as an interactive full-day, hybrid event, the workshop will incorporate <b>short lightning talk presentations</b> (submission details below), 
		<b>small-group discussions</b>, and a <b>world café session</b>. By the end of the workshop, participants will have contributed to the groundwork for an <b>actionable framework</b> to ensure that fairness is consistently and effectively considered in AIED.</p>
		
           <!-- <p> The goal is hence to favor a <strong>community-wide dialogue on new research perspectives</strong> through a workshop having the following objectives: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase awareness of the algorithmic bias problem in IR.</li>
              <li>Identify dimensions influenced by algorithmic bias in IR.</li>
              <li>Solicit contributions addressing algorithmic bias in IR. </li>
              <li>Gain insights into recent advances and open issues in IR.</li>
              <li>Familiarize the IR community with current field practices.</li>
              <li>Uncover gaps in academic and industry research in IR.</li>

          <p>We will consider three different submission types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full papers (12 pages) </strong> should be clearly placed with respect to the state of the art and state the contribution of the proposal

                in detail, experiments should be repeatable, and a comparison with the existing approaches in the literature should be made. </li>
            <li><strong>Reproducibility papers (12 pages) </strong> should repeat prior experiments using the original source code and datasets to show how, why, and when the methods
                work or not (replicability papers) or should repeat prior experiments, preferably using the original source code, in new contexts (e.g., different domains and datasets,
                different evaluation and metrics) to further generalize and validate or not previous work (reproducibility papers).</li>
            <li><strong> Short paper (6 pages) or position papers (4 pages)  </strong> should introduce new point of views in the workshop topics or summarize the experience of a
                group in the field. Practice and experience reports should present in detail real-world scenarios in which search and recommender
                systems are exploited. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Submissions should not exceed the indicated number of pages, including any diagrams and references. </p>

          <p>All submissions will go through a <strong>double-blind</strong> review process and be reviewed by at least three reviewers on the basis of relevance for the workshop, novelty/originality, significance,
             technical quality and correctness, quality and clarity of presentation, quality of references and reproducibility.</p>
          <p>Submitted papers will be rejected without review in case they are not properly anonymized, do not comply with the template, or do not follow the above guidelines.</p>
          <p>The accepted papers and the material generated during the meeting will be available on the workshop website. It is planned to send the workshop proceedings for consideration for inclusion as a <strong>Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) revised post-proceedings volume</strong>, indexed on Google Scholar, DBLP and Scopus. The authors of selected papers may be invited to submit an extended version in a journal special issue.</p>

          <h2>Keynote Speaker: Bingyi Han</h2>
	  <p><b>Title: Teaching the Machine, Missing the Student? Why Fairness in AIEd Is Not Just a Technical Problem</b></p>
	  <p><b>Bio</b>: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bingyi-han/about?authuser=0"><b>Bingyi </b></a>is a PhD researcher in the Human-Computer Interaction group and the Centre for AI and Digital Ethics at the 
			University of Melbourne. Her research takes a human-centred approach to examine the ethical challenges of adopting AI in education, 
			focusing on the lived experiences and perspectives of stakeholders. Her work addresses an underexplored area in the AIEd community, 
			moving the ethical focus beyond data-centric and computational issues to consider user experiences, values, well-being, and the unintended 
			consequences of interacting with AIEd systems. She frames ethical challenges as emerging from the dynamic, interdependent ecosystem of students, 
			teachers, decision-makers, and AIEd technologies. Bingyi has also contributed to industry research on the ethics of emerging technologies at 
			Alibaba's Ali Research Institute. In this keynote, she will explore the broader dimensions of fairness in AIEd, emphasising that fairness extends 
			beyond algorithmic decision-making and data integrity. Drawing on empirical evidence, she will highlight the fairness issues that arise from students' 
			interactions with AI in situated educational contexts and the stakeholder dynamics in the design and adoption process. Ultimately, this keynote calls 
			for a human-centred approach to AIEd ethics that ensures procedural fairness and meaningful student participation in shaping these technologies.</p>
